# password_generator
homework 03
For this assignment, i will be creating a password generator that will meet the below criterias. I will be implementing materials we covered in our Javascript portion in order to make this successful. I will be creating variables, using functions to call on those objects and essentially get them to respond to the user prompts and eventually create a random password.

The following are the criterias needed to be met in order to create a successful password generator. 

GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN prompted for character types to include in the password
THEN I choose lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
