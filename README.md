# password_generator
homework 03
For this assignment, i will be creating a password generator that will meet the below criterias. I will be implementing materials we covered in our Javascript portion in order to make this successful. I will be creating variables, using functions to call on those objects and essentially get them to respond to the user prompts and eventually create a random password. I like the idea of this assignment as it lets me use skills to create a item that can be altered and serve as a fun prompter. However, i found it to be very difficult and needed to use external sources like google and tutoring service to complete it. 

The following are the criterias needed to be met in order to create a successful password generator. 

GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN prompted for character types to include in the password
THEN I choose lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
